# V60 Recipes

## Hario V60

I'm using a ceramic size [01 V60](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P4D5F8?\_encoding=UTF8\&psc=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=chrisltd-20\&linkId=44e4544c626aef91aed0e494d76848ae\&language=en\_US\&ref\_=as\_li\_ss\_tl) with [01 sized filters](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-V60-Coffee-Filters-White-Tabbed/dp/B001U7CVEA?dchild=1\&keywords=v60+filter+01\&qid=1616157948\&s=home-garden\&sr=1-2\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=chrisltd-20\&linkId=e6450ad07f5c07fd359ea98e55cef840\&language=en\_US\&ref\_=as\_li\_ss\_tl). This is adapted from [Hoffmann's recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo).&#x20;

1. Boil 12 oz / 340 g of water. Youâ€™ll be using 9 oz / 220 g of water for the coffee, and some of the rest to rinse the filter, and warm your cup and cone.
2. Grind 13 grams of beans to about a table salt size (Setting 10 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as\_li\_ss\_tl?ie=UTF8\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=chrisltd-20\&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd\&language=en\_US) or 20 clicks on the Comandante C40)
3. Run some of the hot water through your filter, cone, and into your mug to heat them up
4. Discard the water in your mug
5. Pour the grinds into the filter and cone
6. With your finger create a little indentation in the middle of grounds to help with the bloom phase.
7. Pour about 30 g of the boiling water on the coffee and let it bloom for 30-45 seconds
8. Over the next 30 seconds, pour the next 90 g of water so you have a total of 120 g.
9. Gently swirl the V60
10. Pour the remaining 100 g of water over the coffee over the next 30 seconds.&#x20;
11. Do a little stir in one direction, then a little stir in the opposite direction. This will move the coffee gently from the sides of the filter.
12. Let it drain a bit, then gently swirl the brewer one last time.
13. Let it drain, and throw away the filter and coffee
14. Aim to finish drawdown by 3 minutes and 30 seconds
15. Stir the coffee in your mug
16. Enjoy!
