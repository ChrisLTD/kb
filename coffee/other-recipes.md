# V60 & French Press Recipes

## Hario V60

I'm using a ceramic size [01 V60](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P4D5F8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=44e4544c626aef91aed0e494d76848ae&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) with [01 sized filters](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-V60-Coffee-Filters-White-Tabbed/dp/B001U7CVEA?dchild=1&keywords=v60+filter+01&qid=1616157948&s=home-garden&sr=1-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=e6450ad07f5c07fd359ea98e55cef840&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). This is adapted from [Hoffmann's recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo). 

1. Boil 12 oz / 340 g of water. Youâ€™ll be using 9 oz / 240 g of water for the coffee, and some of the rest to rinse the filter, and warm your cup and cone.
2. Grind 14 grams of beans to about a table salt size \(Setting 10 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Run some of the hot water through your filter, cone, and into your mug to heat them up
4. Discard the water in your mug
5. Pour the grinds into the filter and cone
6. With your finger create a little indentation in the middle of grounds to help with the bloom phase.
7. Pour about 30 g of the boiling water on the coffee and let it bloom for 30-45 seconds
8. Over the next 30 seconds, pour the next 110 g of water
9. Gently swirl the V60
10. Pour the remaining 100 g of water over the coffee over the next 30 seconds. 
11. Do a little stir in one direction, then a little stir in the opposite direction. This will move the coffee gently from the sides of the filter.
12. Let it drain a bit, then gently swirl the brewer one last time.
13. Let it drain, and throw away the filter and coffee
14. Stir the coffee in your mug
15. Enjoy!

## French press single cup

1. Boil water \(you'll want a bit more than 8 oz / 225 g\)
2. Coarsely grind 18 grams of beans \(setting 28 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Rinse your mug and French press with warm water
4. Pour the ground coffee into the French press \(I'm currently using a [Bodum 12 oz model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HC22KQH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=293e67eae30293ca055e27cfe4905e7f&language=en_US)\)
5. Pour, don't dump, 8 oz / 225 g of hot water into the French press. You can measure it, or on my Bodum that means filling it up to about a finger width below the top metal ring.
6. Stir the coffee to make sure all of the grounds are steeping.
7. Let the coffee steep for 4 minutes
8. Slowly tamp the coffee down with the French press plunger
9. Pour into your mug and enjoy
