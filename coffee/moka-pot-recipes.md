# Moka Pot Recipes

## Moka pot \(Aluminum\)

I'm using this 3 cup [Bialeltti Moka Express](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Bialetti-Moka-Express-Stovetop/dp/B0000CF3Q6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B0000CF3Q6&pd_rd_r=824f42e9-fc1d-45bb-8488-93ea1e090787&pd_rd_w=AZjCe&pd_rd_wg=ZqKzL&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=Q5E29HG6XRSEX1AX4S9K&psc=1&refRID=Q5E29HG6XRSEX1AX4S9K&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=1a5a84cd47ea5008269747552da37b5d&language=en_US).

1. Boil water
2. Grind 17 grams of beans somewhere between espresso and medium grind. \(Setting 12 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Once the water is boiled, pour it into the bottom section of the Moka pot to right below the safety valve
4. Put your ground coffee into the coffee basket. Don't tamp.
5. Screw together the top and bottom of the Moka pot. Because you poured hot water into the bottom you'll likely need a towel or something to hold the bottom of the pot without burning yourself.
6. Put the pot on your smallest burner, and turn it to medium heat or whatever just covers the bottom with flame.
7. Open the top of the Moka pot so you can monitor the brewing
8. After the coffee starts coming out, turn the heat down low. 
9. Close the lid and take it off the heat as soon as the brewed coffee gets right beneath the bottom of the V of the pouring spout. \(On my 3 cup model, that's about a third of the way.\)
10. Run the Moka pot under cold water to stop the brewing process. Be careful, the Moka pot is still pretty hot.
11. Pour your coffee into a cup and enjoy.
12. Once the Moka Part is cool enough, take it apart, rinse the inside with warm water, and dry it with a towel or paper towel. Let it completely air dry before putting it back together and storing it.

I'm using this 4 cup [Bialeltti Venus Moka pot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08556XV39?pd_rd_i=B07ZKZXM4B&pd_rd_w=Ahlpd&pf_rd_p=4269e1a0-a218-4fbd-9748-1cd337d2f2a5&pd_rd_wg=veWc3&pf_rd_r=QW0BRC2D0ZMVGC2X4KQ1&pd_rd_r=d3a9b097-a9a5-4eba-a072-b2ac24743af2&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzSFFBU0lPTkhROUFWJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODM2NjU5MzFDVU5SOVZUSjJKRyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTY2OTIzMUVYOUVYUDZJNVhTSyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2RldGFpbCZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=df7a89b79ac98c5a8d3c40abd19b7e38&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). I've found the coffee it makes to be somewhat weaker and smoother than the aluminum models, so I've been experimenting with finer grind sizes to make it nearly as strong.

1. Grind 19 grams of beans somewhere just above espresso grind. \(Setting 6 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)

6. Open the top of the Moka pot so you can monitor the brewing
7. After the coffee starts coming out, turn the heat down low. 
8. Take it off the heat as soon as the coffee coming from the spout turns a lighter color, almost clear.
9. Run the Moka pot under cold water to stop the brewing process. Be careful, the Moka pot is still pretty hot.
10. Pour your coffee into a cup and enjoy.
