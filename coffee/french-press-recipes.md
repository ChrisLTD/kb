# French Press Recipes

## French press single cup

1. Boil water \(you'll want a bit more than 8 oz / 225 g\)
2. Coarsely grind 18 grams of beans \(setting 28 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Rinse your mug and French press with warm water
4. Pour the ground coffee into the French press \(I'm currently using a [Bodum 12 oz model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HC22KQH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=293e67eae30293ca055e27cfe4905e7f&language=en_US)\)
5. Pour, don't dump, 8 oz / 225 g of hot water into the French press. You can measure it, or on my Bodum that means filling it up to about a finger width below the top metal ring.
6. Stir the coffee to make sure all of the grounds are steeping.
7. Let the coffee steep for 4 minutes
8. Slowly tamp the coffee down with the French press plunger
9. Pour into your mug and enjoy
