# Coffee Beans & Equipment

## Beans

I get whole bean coffee delivered every couple weeks from [Counter Culture](https://counterculturecoffee.com/) and [Yes Plz Coffee](https://www.yesplz.coffee/). There is usually a couple days lag from when they roast their coffee and when it arrives in the mail, but that's a huge improvement over grocery store coffee that might have been roasted months and months ago. Switching to recently roasted beans is the biggest upgrade I made to the taste of coffee I was brewing.
