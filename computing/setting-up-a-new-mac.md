# Setting up a new Mac

Moving to a new Mac takes some time. These are the steps I usually take when upgrading to a new machine.

1. Run Time Machine on the computer you're replacing 
2. Boot up the new computer and use Migration Assistant to load up your new computer with the contents of the Time Machine backup
3. Now that you're booted into your new system it's time to test out your machine.
4. But first, you'll need to re-sign into your Apple account in System Prefs under Apple ID. \(The system will likely nag you to do this\)
5. Use DirEqual to compare a few of your key document folders to your Time Machine backup to make sure Migration Assistant worked properly.
6. Make sure you can type on the keyboard. Test every key.
7. Make sure the speakers work \(if you heard the startup chime, you're fine\)
8. Test the web cam \(Photo Booth should work\).
9. Test the microphone \(I used Skype, but you could use FaceTime\).
10. Test the headphone jack \(assuming your computer comes with one!\)
11. Test the other ports like USB-C.
12. Test Bluetooth
13. Run Geekbench to see if you're getting advertised performance
14. Use [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net/) to see if your Wifi is OK
15. If you've gotten to this point, your new computer Your computer is ready to use and configure!
16. Setup your internal and external keyboards so that Caps Lock is set to Esc. Also setup any Windows keyboards so Alt is Cmd and the Win Key is Option.
17. Rename your computer in System Prefs / Sharing
18. Add any additional fingers to Touch ID prefs if your system has Touch ID.
19. Login in to your password manager \(LastPass, 1Password, etc.\). This should help with the other steps.
20. Set up Dropbox, you don't have to give it accessibility permissions
21. Enable Watch Unlock under System Prefs / S
22. Review your startup items. I had to add Rest, and BeFocused Pro to my list of startup apps
23. Get an empty disk, and create a new Time Machine backup
24. Open up Backblaze and have it inherit the backup state from your last computer
