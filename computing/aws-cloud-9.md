# AWS Cloud 9

When creating your instance if you see this error:&#x20;

> The following resource(s) failed to create: \[Instance]&#x20;

Itâ€™s because you have a legacy account. Setting up a new server now requires you to explicitly pick a subnet in the advanced settings.

## Setting up SSH Keys

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your@email.com"
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy output to Github or Bitbucket where you're pushing and pulling your code from.

## Setting up Docker Compose
