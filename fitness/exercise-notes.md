# Exercise Notes

## Leg Press

Focus on the quads\
\
Put your feet on the lower half of the plate, but no so low that your heels lift off at the bottom of the movement.\
\
Lower back as low as possible.\
\
Don’t let your lower back round.\
\
Get weight lifting shoes\
\
Legs should be wide enough that your knees can go to the sides of your stomach at the bottom\
\
Ask yourself, am I going low enough, is my back still tight?\
\
10-20 rep range will be best\
\
Don’t forcefully lock out your knees
