# Podcasting

I currently co-host [The Wastebasket](http://wastebasketpodcast.com/) podcast with Jordan Mendenhall. We discuss technology, culture, and we review movie on each episode.

I hardly have a professional podcasting setup, but I think we sound decent. These are the tools we're currently using.

For microphones, we both use [Samson Meteor Mics](https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Meteor-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B004MF39YS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=cd89772b08224f3814684032a4d54624&language=en_US) connected with USB. I haven't tested to see if it really works, but we also use [this PEMOTech pop filter](https://www.amazon.com/PEMOTech-Microphone-Windscreen-Recording-Streaming/dp/B01J5OTVTC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=pop+filter+samson+meteor+mic&qid=1591817027&s=electronics&sr=1-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=4ffd44d71eaf4ff23ea50f70534e54f0&language=en_US) on our mics.

On the listening side, I use [Bose SoundLink Around Ear Wireless Headphones II](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-around-ear-wireless-headphones/dp/B0117RGG8E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=bose+quietcomfort+wireless&qid=1591816477&s=electronics&sr=1-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=53003237613ba135435d25e1acb682bd&language=en_US) wired into my laptop. Bluetooth is too flaky, and I don't want any lag.

We call each other using [Microsoft's Skype](https://www.skype.com/) service.

On the Mac, I can record both sides of the conversation on different audio channels using the app [Piezo](https://rogueamoeba.com/piezo/). Jordan records his side using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

I edit the show using [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) on Mac and with [Ferrite Recording Studio](https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/) on iPad using an Apple Pencil. Using Ferrite is actually kind of fun. Definitely worth trying if you find editing on your PC a chore.

When Jordan edits the show he uses [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

I prep the final MP3 file with titles, show art, and notes using [Forecast](https://overcast.fm/forecast).

We host the show for free on [Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/), owned by Spotify.
