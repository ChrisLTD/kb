# Coffee

I make coffee with recently roasted beans, a burr grinder, and usually an [AeroPress](https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker-Bitterness/dp/B0047BIWSK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=88cffaf4225567ad72181e8f5d5797e8&language=en_US).

I get whole bean coffee delivered every couple weeks from [Counter Culture](https://counterculturecoffee.com/) and [Yes Plz Coffee](https://www.yesplz.coffee/). There is usually a couple days lag from when they roast their coffee and when it arrives in the mail, but that's a huge improvement over grocery store coffee that might have been roasted months and months ago. Switching to recently roasted beans is the biggest upgrade I made to the taste of coffee I was brewing.

### My AeroPress recipe

1. Run the rubber plunger side of the AeroPress under water \(this makes the last step a bit smoother\).
2. Pour 2.5 tablespoon \(18 grams\) of beans measured with the [scoop from AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/product/scoop/) for each cup in my [Baratza Encore grinder](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US). 
3. Grind the beans on the 11 setting on the Baratza Encore.
4. Boil about 10 oz / 280 g water on the stove top using a kettle \([mine is this glass model](https://www.amazon.com/CAF%C3%89-BREW-COLLECTION-Stovetop-Whistling/dp/B013JM253U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=glass+kettle&qid=1591909317&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=516c42e37ea40e28e72143dcce080c10&language=en_US)\).
5. After the water is boiled, wet the paper filter in the AeroPress with a few drops. I also warm up my mug by putting some hot water in the mug and pouring it out after a few seconds.
6. Screw the filter and cap on the AeroPress, place on the mug, and pour in the ground coffee.
7. Pour splash of hot water \(about 20 g\)  into the AeroPress \(if the beans are super fresh, you should see some [bloom](https://theroasterspack.com/blogs/news/13758377-what-is-the-bloom-and-why-should-you-care#:~:text=The%20bloom%20is%20the%20part,begins%20the%20brewing%2Fextraction%20process.)\), tamp down with your AeroPress stirrer or the bottom of a wooden spoon.
8. Wait 30 seconds.
9. Pour in more hot water until it reaches the top of the 4 mark on the side of the AeroPress. If you're weighing, use a total of 230 g of water.
10. Wait 60 seconds.
11. Stir the coffee ~10 times with your stirrer or spoon.
12. Press the plunger down on the AeroPress until it reaches the bottom.
13. Take off the cap, and eject the used coffee grinds into the garbage.
14. Enjoy!

If you're curious about the AeroPress, the official site has pretty good instructions and some videos you can [check out](https://aeropress.com/use-it-now/getting-started/).

### My French press single cup recipe

1. Boil water \(you'll want a bit more than 8 oz / 225 g\)
2. Coarsely grind 18 grams of beans \(setting 28 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Rinse your mug and French press with warm water
4. Pour the ground coffee into the French press \(I'm currently using a [Bodum 12 oz model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HC22KQH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=293e67eae30293ca055e27cfe4905e7f&language=en_US)\)
5. Pour, don't dump, 8 oz / 225 g of hot water into the French press. You can measure it, or on my Bodum that means filling it up to about a finger width below the top metal ring.
6. Let the coffee steep for 4 minutes
7. Slowly tamp the coffee down with the French press plunger
8. Pour into your mug and enjoy

### My Moka pot recipe

Modified from [this James Hoffmann video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyBYuu-wJI). I'm using this 3 cup [Bialeltti Moka pot](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Bialetti-Moka-Express-Stovetop/dp/B0000CF3Q6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B0000CF3Q6&pd_rd_r=824f42e9-fc1d-45bb-8488-93ea1e090787&pd_rd_w=AZjCe&pd_rd_wg=ZqKzL&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=Q5E29HG6XRSEX1AX4S9K&psc=1&refRID=Q5E29HG6XRSEX1AX4S9K&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=1a5a84cd47ea5008269747552da37b5d&language=en_US).

1. Boil water
2. Grind 16 grams of beans somewhere between espresso and medium grind. \(Setting 12 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Once the water is boiled, pour it into the bottom section of the Moka pot to right below the safety valve
4. Put your ground coffee into the coffee basket. Don't tamp.
5. Screw together the top and bottom of the Moka pot. Because you poured hot water into the bottom you'll likely need a towel or something to hold the bottom of the pot without burning yourself.
6. Put the pot on your smallest burner, and turn it to medium heat or whatever just covers the bottom with flame.
7. Open the top of the Moka pot so you can monitor the brewing
8. After the coffee starts coming out, turn the heat down a bit lower. 
9. Eventually it will start gurgling and the coffee coming out of the spout will look more watery. Once this happens, close the lid, take the pot off for the flame, and run cold water over the bottom of the pot to cool it down.
10. Pour your coffee into a mug and enjoy.
11. Once the Moka Part is cool enough, take it apart, rinse the inside with warm water, and dry it with a towel or paper towel. Let it completely air dry before putting it back together and storing it.

### My Hario V60 Recipe

I'm using this [plastic V60](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Coffee-Dripper-White/dp/B000P4D5HG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=0b098d0724af6d2650b385f1b4b41f23&language=en_US) with [02 sized natural filters](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-V60-Coffee-Filters-Natural-Tabbed/dp/B001O0R46I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B001O0R46I&pd_rd_r=a05fac9c-4e7e-4d61-9d8a-c2d373b2114e&pd_rd_w=XfRVQ&pd_rd_wg=ByWQR&pf_rd_p=ce6c479b-ef53-49a6-845b-bbbf35c28dd3&pf_rd_r=XMY3K5V2MJQHPMAADFXX&psc=1&refRID=XMY3K5V2MJQHPMAADFXX&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=ccbae1ce09974c5dfb481332ec634f89&language=en_US).

1. Boil 12 oz / 340 g of water. Youâ€™ll be using 9 oz / 255 g of water for the coffee, and some of the rest to rinse the filter, and warm your cup and cone.
2. Grind 15 grams of beans to about a table salt size \(Setting 12 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Run some of the hot water through your filter, cone, and into your mug to heat them up
4. Discard the water in your mug
5. Pour the grinds into the filter and cone
6. With your finger create a little indentation in the middle of grounds to help with the bloom phase.
7. Pour about an ounce / 30 g of the boiling water on the coffee and let it bloom for 30-45 seconds
8. Pour the remaining 8 oz / 225 g of water over the coffee very slowly. Try not to let it pool.
9. Let it drain, and throw away the filter and coffee
10. Stir the coffee in your mug
11. Enjoy!
