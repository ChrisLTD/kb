# Coffee

I make coffee with recently roasted beans, a burr grinder, and usually an [AeroPress](https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker-Bitterness/dp/B0047BIWSK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=88cffaf4225567ad72181e8f5d5797e8&language=en_US).

I get whole bean coffee delivered every couple weeks from [Counter Culture](https://counterculturecoffee.com/) and [Yes Plz Coffee](https://www.yesplz.coffee/). There is usually a couple days lag from when they roast their coffee and when it arrives in the mail, but that's a huge improvement over grocery store coffee that might have been roasted months and months ago. Switching to recently roasted beans is the biggest upgrade I made to the taste of coffee I was brewing.

### My AeroPress recipe

1. Run the rubber plunger side of the AeroPress under water \(this makes the last step a bit smoother\).
2. Pour 2.5 tablespoon \(18 grams\) of beans measured with the [scoop from AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/product/scoop/) for each cup in my [Baratza Encore grinder](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US). 
3. Grind the beans on the 11 setting on the Baratza Encore.
4. Boil water on the stove top using a kettle \([mine is this glass model](https://www.amazon.com/CAF%C3%89-BREW-COLLECTION-Stovetop-Whistling/dp/B013JM253U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=glass+kettle&qid=1591909317&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=516c42e37ea40e28e72143dcce080c10&language=en_US)\).
5. After the water is boiled, wet the paper filter in the AeroPress with a few drops. I also warm up my mug by putting some hot water in the mug and pouring it out after a few seconds.
6. Screw the filter and cap on the AeroPress, place on the mug, and pour in the ground coffee.
7. Pour splash of hot water into the AeroPress \(if the beans are super fresh, you should see some [bloom](https://theroasterspack.com/blogs/news/13758377-what-is-the-bloom-and-why-should-you-care#:~:text=The%20bloom%20is%20the%20part,begins%20the%20brewing%2Fextraction%20process.)\), tamp down with your AeroPress stirrer or the bottom of a wooden spoon.
8. Wait 30 seconds.
9. Pour in more hot water until it reaches the top of the 4 mark on the side of the AeroPress.
10. Wait 60 seconds.
11. Stir the coffee ~10 times with your stirrer or spoon.
12. Press the plunger down on the AeroPress until it reaches the bottom.
13. Take off the cap, and eject the used coffee grinds into the garbage.
14. Enjoy!

If you're curious about the AeroPress, the official site has pretty good instructions and some videos you can [check out](https://aeropress.com/use-it-now/getting-started/).

### My French press single cup recipe

1. Boil water \(you'll want a bit more than 8 oz\)
2. Coarsely grind 18 grams of beans \(setting 28 on the Baratza Encore\)
3. Rinse your mug and French press with warm water
4. Pour the ground coffee into the French press \(I'm currently using a [Bodum 12 oz model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HC22KQH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=293e67eae30293ca055e27cfe4905e7f&language=en_US)\)
5. Pour, don't dump, 8 oz of hot water into the French press. You can measure it, or on my Bodum that means filling it up to about a finger width below the top metal ring.
6. Let the coffee steep for 4 minutes
7. Slowly tamp the coffee down with the French press plunger
8. Pour into your mug and enjoy
