# Coffee

I make coffee with recently roasted beans, a burr grinder, and usually an [AeroPress](https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker-Bitterness/dp/B0047BIWSK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=88cffaf4225567ad72181e8f5d5797e8&language=en_US).

I get whole bean coffee delivered every couple weeks from [Counter Culture](https://counterculturecoffee.com/) and [Yes Plz Coffee](https://www.yesplz.coffee/). There is usually a couple days lag from when they roast their coffee and when it arrives in the mail, but that's a huge improvement over grocery store coffee that might have been roasted months and months ago. Switching to recently roasted beans is the biggest upgrade I made to the taste of coffee I was brewing.

## AeroPress

1. Run the rubber plunger side of the AeroPress under water \(this makes pressing the plunger smoother\).
2. Pour 2.5 tablespoon \(18 grams\) of beans measured with the [scoop from AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/product/scoop/) for each cup in my [Baratza Encore grinder](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US). 
3. Grind the beans on the 11 setting on the Baratza Encore.
4. Boil about 10 oz / 280 g of water \(you'll be using 230 g\)

    on the stove top using a kettle \([mine is this glass model](https://www.amazon.com/CAF%C3%89-BREW-COLLECTION-Stovetop-Whistling/dp/B013JM253U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=glass+kettle&qid=1591909317&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=516c42e37ea40e28e72143dcce080c10&language=en_US)\).

5. After the water is boiled, wet the paper filter in the AeroPress with a few drops. I also warm up my mug by putting some hot water in the mug and pouring it out after a few seconds.
6. Screw the filter and cap on the AeroPress, place on the mug, and pour in the ground coffee.
7. Slowly pour in 230 g of the hot water.
8. Stir inside the vessel to make sure all the grounds are saturated.
9. Press the plunger in the top just a bit then pull back up to create a vacuum and stop the draining.
10. Wait 90 seconds.
11. Slowly press the plunger down on the AeroPress until it reaches the bottom.
12. Take off the cap, and eject the used coffee grinds into the garbage.
13. Stir your coffee.
14. Enjoy!

If you're curious about the AeroPress, the official site has pretty good instructions and some videos you can [check out](https://aeropress.com/use-it-now/getting-started/).

## French press single cup

1. Boil water \(you'll want a bit more than 8 oz / 225 g\)
2. Coarsely grind 18 grams of beans \(setting 28 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Rinse your mug and French press with warm water
4. Pour the ground coffee into the French press \(I'm currently using a [Bodum 12 oz model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HC22KQH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=293e67eae30293ca055e27cfe4905e7f&language=en_US)\)
5. Pour, don't dump, 8 oz / 225 g of hot water into the French press. You can measure it, or on my Bodum that means filling it up to about a finger width below the top metal ring.
6. Stir the coffee to make sure all of the grounds are steeping.
7. Let the coffee steep for 4 minutes
8. Slowly tamp the coffee down with the French press plunger
9. Pour into your mug and enjoy

## Moka pot

I'm using this 3 cup [Bialeltti Moka pot](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Bialetti-Moka-Express-Stovetop/dp/B0000CF3Q6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B0000CF3Q6&pd_rd_r=824f42e9-fc1d-45bb-8488-93ea1e090787&pd_rd_w=AZjCe&pd_rd_wg=ZqKzL&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=Q5E29HG6XRSEX1AX4S9K&psc=1&refRID=Q5E29HG6XRSEX1AX4S9K&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=1a5a84cd47ea5008269747552da37b5d&language=en_US).

1. Boil water
2. Grind 17 grams of beans somewhere between espresso and medium grind. \(Setting 12 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Once the water is boiled, pour it into the bottom section of the Moka pot to right below the safety valve
4. Put your ground coffee into the coffee basket. Don't tamp.
5. Screw together the top and bottom of the Moka pot. Because you poured hot water into the bottom you'll likely need a towel or something to hold the bottom of the pot without burning yourself.
6. Put the pot on your smallest burner, and turn it to medium heat or whatever just covers the bottom with flame.
7. Open the top of the Moka pot so you can monitor the brewing
8. After the coffee starts coming out, turn the heat down low. 
9. Close the lid and take it off the heat as soon as the brewed coffee gets right beneath the bottom of the V of the pouring spout. \(On my 3 cup model, that's about a third of the way.\)
10. Run the Moka pot under cold water to stop the brewing process. Be careful, the Moka pot is still pretty hot.
11. Pour your coffee into a cup and enjoy.
12. Once the Moka Part is cool enough, take it apart, rinse the inside with warm water, and dry it with a towel or paper towel. Let it completely air dry before putting it back together and storing it.

## Hario V60

I'm using a ceramic size [01 V60](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P4D5F8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=44e4544c626aef91aed0e494d76848ae&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) with [01 sized filters](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-V60-Coffee-Filters-White-Tabbed/dp/B001U7CVEA?dchild=1&keywords=v60+filter+01&qid=1616157948&s=home-garden&sr=1-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=e6450ad07f5c07fd359ea98e55cef840&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).

1. Boil 12 oz / 340 g of water. Youâ€™ll be using 9 oz / 255 g of water for the coffee, and some of the rest to rinse the filter, and warm your cup and cone.
2. Grind 15 grams of beans to about a table salt size \(Setting 12 on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Run some of the hot water through your filter, cone, and into your mug to heat them up
4. Discard the water in your mug
5. Pour the grinds into the filter and cone
6. With your finger create a little indentation in the middle of grounds to help with the bloom phase.
7. Pour about an ounce / 30 g of the boiling water on the coffee and let it bloom for 30-45 seconds
8. Pour the remaining 8 oz / 225 g of water over the coffee very slowly. Try not to let it pool.
9. Let it drain, and throw away the filter and coffee
10. Stir the coffee in your mug
11. Enjoy!

## Fellow Prismo \(AeroPress "espresso"\)

Using the [Prismo attachment](https://www.amazon.com/Fellow-Pressure-Actuated-Attachment-AeroPress-Espresso-Style/dp/B079YBT2LJ?dchild=1&keywords=fellow+prismo&qid=1616157189&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFOVA0MDNUMEswOTAmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0Nzg1MDFFQzRNUk1YTTNDNiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjk4MjMzMVpWRURVMVVLSEVIRSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=64f47e808f7a65d64fbdb6e979a4ce40&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) for an AeroPress you can get kind of close to an espresso-like concoction using the official recipe. I've upped the liquid amount a tad. 

1. Boil 100 g of water. You'll be using 55 g for the actual brew
2. Grind 20 g of coffee at the espresso setting on your grinder. \(I use the finest setting on the [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=506f78ac8127812a94bcf7c9032f63cd&language=en_US)\)
3. Run the rubber part of the AeroPress under some water to get it ready. Cold water is fine.
4. Use some of the boiled water to preheat your cup. Keep the water boiling for the brew process. You want the water right off the boil when you start brewing.
5. Attach the Prismo to the AeroPress, and set on your cup
6. Pour in the grinds, and add 55 g of boiling water
7. Stir for 20 seconds. \(I use the AeroPress stirring paddle\)
8. Let it steep for 40 more seconds
9. Put the plunger in the top of the AeroPress and push it through
10. Take off the Prismo, and eject the used coffee grinds into the garbage.
11. Enjoy your "espresso"
12. When your done make sure to wash the Prismo and filter gently with some mild soap and let it dry.
